A website that allows people  to  buy  and  sell  a  crypto 
is called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each 
user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street 
number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.

Project contains:
All deposit,  withdraw,  transfer,  buy,  and  sell  records  need  to  be  maintained  in  the  database: 
which operations have been performed, the amount involved,  when, and by whom, etc for 
future querying. In particular, the following interfaces will be implemented:  1) Balance page: 
each user can easily check the balances of her PPS and dollar; 2) Activity page: each user can 
easily check all her activities anti-chronologically, including deposit, withdraw, transfer, buy, 
sell,  etc.  Users can also  follow  each other  so  that  followers can navigate and see the 
information of followings easily. A user can change her preference to determine whether her 
followers can see her personal sensitive information or not (such as balances). By default, all 
information can be seen by followers and followers only.
